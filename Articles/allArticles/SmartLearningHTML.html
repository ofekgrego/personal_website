            <h1>Smart Learning</h1>

            <h2>A Way to make you learning better.</h2>
            <a>Introduction</a>
            <p>In an era where the hustle culture is so big, everyone is trying to make the best out of his time. People work for hours to keep up with the world.
                Nowadays, people can’t learn only from Teachers and Lecturers, they must learn by themselves. The problem is that most *people don’t learn to learn*, and they waste hours upon hours.
                In school, college, university, etc. People learn only with someone, and they didn’t have the desire to learn alone. In our generation, self-learn is not even an option, it’s a must.
                People must know how to self-learn, and how to Smart Learn.
            </p>

            <a>How To Smart Learning?</a>
            <p><b>Pomodoro</b>
                    First of all, what is Pomodoro? 
                    Pomodoro time management technique for not overwork, its work like this - 
                     You work for 25 minutes and take a break for 5 minutes, every 4 laps, you take a long break. Pretty simple right?
                    So why is Pomodoro so helpful for learning?
                    Simply put, people can’t work for a long period of time, they just open the phone and
                    forget about the work. With Pomodoro, you know that the break is soon, and you only have to work a short period of time each lap.
                    
                    <b>Spaced Repetition</b>
                    The name probably explains most of this technique, but let me explain in short.
                    Spaced Repetition means that you don’t learn the day before the test all day, but instead, you learn a week before the test, each day a little.
                    How does it work? Our brain has muscle memory, when you learn each day you train the brain to remember the material better.
                    Spaced Repetition is perfect when you are trying to memorize a lot of subjects.
                    
                    
                    <b>Feynman Technique</b>
                    Another simple yet very effective technique to learn a subject.
                    In this technique you have to think like you’re going to teach the subject to a 6-grade kid, it means that you have to know the subject perfectly, in each direction.
                    This technique works because you need to simplify the subject and think about how to approach a hard subject in an easy way.
                    
             </p>

            <a>Summary</a>
            <p>I really believe that if you use even one of these techniques your learning will be much better, and you learn more in a shorter time.
                        I use these techniques in my daily learning and it helps a lot.
                        Thanks for Reading. See you in the next article :)
